# Day08_SurveyForm
14.05.2025 || A survey form only used HTML , no styling. 

Todays ChatGPT challenge was to make a survey form. 
I had to write down some comments in my code because ChatGPT did not go into more detail for the instructions. 
Of course I could have ask if it can do so but this way I can also learn some things. 

Instructions:
- Do a main heading like e.g. "Tell Me About You!"
- Do a <form> element that includes:
- An <input> element that includes:
  - Each Input has a <label>
  - Text Input: <input type="text">
  - Email input
  - multiple checkbox inputs with different labels like: gaming, reading, etc.
  - radio input
  - Use a <textarea> element
  - Do a submit <button>. You can use <input> or <button> for that.
